Color Mixer
==========

A Java implementation of the Kubelka-Munk Theory of Reflectance for mixing RGB colors.  This implementation uses a simplified version of the Kubelka-Munk model that assumes all colors have the same concentration when blending and that all colors are opaque.

Goal
==========
The ultimate goal of this project is to have a intuitive (subtractive color model) yet accurate color mixing function of the form:

`Color mix(Color a, Color b)`

Usage
==========
The KMColorUtils class contains two mix methods for conveniently mixing java.awt.Color objects.

`public static Color mix(Color colorA, Color colorB);`

`public static Color mix(Color... colors);`
